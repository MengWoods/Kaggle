# Competition Description

While It's pretty easy for people to identify subtle differences in photos, computers still have a ways to go. Visually similar items are tough for computers to count, like this overlapping bunch of bananas.

Or consider this photo of a family of foxes camouflaged in the wild - where do the foxes end and where does the grass begins?

To solve this problem and enhance the state of the art in object detection and classification, the annual ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge (ILSVRC) began in 2010. This year, Kaggle is excited and honored to be the new home of the official ImageNet Object Localization competition. Participants are challenged with identifying all objects within an image, so those images can then be classified and annotated.

Already, because of this competition, there’s been a 4.2× reduction in image classification error (from 28.2% to 6.7%) and a 1.7× reduction in localization error (from 42.5% to 25.3%) between 2010 and 2014 alone. Can you improve the accuracy even further?

## Competition Overview

The validation and test data will consist of __150,000__ photographs, collected from Flickr and other search engines, hand labeled with the presence or absence of 1000 object categories. The 1000 object categories contain both internal nodes and leaf nodes of ImageNet, but do not overlap with each other.

A random subset of 50,000 of the images with labels will be released as the training set along with a list of the 1000 categories. The remaining images will be used as the test set.

The validation and test data for this competition are not contained in the ImageNet training data.
